## 🔧 Configuration

### Shared Types
Mobile app imports shared TypeScript types from `../shared/schema.ts`:

```typescript
import type { AircraftListing, User, Rental } from '@shared/schema';
```

All API responses are properly typed using these shared schemas, ensuring type safety across the entire stack.

### API Configuration
Backend API URL is configured in `src/services/api.ts`:

```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://readysetfly.us';
```

### Authentication
The app uses Replit Auth (OIDC) for authentication:
- Session cookies are automatically included in API requests (`withCredentials: true`)
- `useAuth()` hook provides current user state
- AuthScreen handles sign-in flow via web browser redirect

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile framework
- **Expo**: Development toolchain
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **React Navigation**: Navigation system
- **TanStack Query**: Data fetching & caching
- **Axios**: HTTP client
- **Expo Vector Icons**: Icon library

## 📝 Development Notes

- LSP errors before `npm install` are expected
- App connects to production backend API
- Uses same database and authentication as web app
- No admin dashboard (web-only feature)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm start`
3. Scan QR code with Expo Go
4. See live updates as you develop!

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Dependencies not installing:**
- Make sure you're in the `mobile/` directory
- Try `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`

**App won't load:**
- Ensure backend API is running
- Check your internet connection
- Try clearing Expo cache: `expo start --clear`

**Can't scan QR code:**
- Ensure phone and computer are on same network
- Try tunnel mode: `expo start --tunnel`
