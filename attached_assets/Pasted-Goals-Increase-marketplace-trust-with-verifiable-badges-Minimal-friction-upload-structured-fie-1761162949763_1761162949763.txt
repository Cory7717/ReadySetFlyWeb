Goals

Increase marketplace trust with verifiable badges.

Minimal friction: upload + structured fields + automated checks + light manual review.

Clear profile status badges visible to all users.

1) Renter Verification
Data to Collect

DOB (YYYY-MM-DD)

Phone + email (verified)

Government ID upload (front/back)

Selfie liveness (optional, if provider available)

Payment method on file (Stripe)

Optional: Pilot license (if renter flies, else skip):

FAA certificate number + name → auto-match

Optional photo of certificate

Automation & Checks

Email + phone OTP verification.

If pilot info provided:

Validate certificate number + name against FAA Airmen Registry (local dataset or live look-up).

2) Owner (Aircraft) Verification
Proof of Ownership

Collect:

N-Number (tail), make/model, serial

Upload: Certificate of Aircraft Registration (AC 8050-3) or temporary authority (8050-64)

If registrant is an LLC and lister differs: authorization letter (PDF) or dry lease doc

Automate:

Maintenance & Inspection Currency

Collect uploads:

Annual inspection sign-off (last 12 calendar months)

If applicable (for hire/flight instruction): 100-hour inspection entry

Signer details: A&P name, cert #, IA # (if annual)

Optional: AD compliance / tracking snapshot (CAMP/Traxxall/Flightdocs/SierraTrax PDF)

Validate (form rules + reviewer checklist):

Annual entry includes: type, date, aircraft TT, signer name, signature, cert #, IA if annual

Compute due:

Annual_due = end of month (last_annual_date + 12 calendar months)

100-hour_remaining = 100 − (current_tach − last_100hr_tach) (if required)

Mechanic Verification:

Cross-check signer A&P/IA by name/cert # in FAA Airmen (Mechanic) search (store “ap_verified: true/false”).

Badges (Owner/Aircraft)
